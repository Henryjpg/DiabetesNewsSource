 <h1>The Reason Why I Created DRS</h1>
 <p>I created DRS because my mom was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a very young age. She wasn't able to access news about important things like new breakthroughs in diabetical history. My hopes for this website is that you are able to get access to all the news you need.</p>

  <h1>Other People Like You</h1>
 <p>If you just got diagnosed to diabetes I understand you're having a tough time, but just no there are a lot of people just like you. Some people with diabetes are Nick Jonas in the "Jonas brothers", pop singer Adele, famous movie star Tom Hanks, etc.</p>
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>This site is for people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by accident). This reaction destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, called beta cells. This process can go on for months and even years before any symptoms appear.</p>
